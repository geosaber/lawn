\title{Minimum}
\usage{
lawn_min(polygons, points, in_field, out_field, lint = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{polygons}{a FeatureCollection of \code{\link{data-Polygon}} features}

\item{points}{a FeatureCollection of \code{\link{data-Point}} features}

\item{in_field}{the field in input data to analyze}

\item{out_field}{the field in which to store results}

\item{lint}{(logical) Lint or not. Uses geojsonhint. Takes up increasing time
as the object to get linted increases in size, so probably use by
default for small objects, but not for large if you know they are good geojson
objects. Default: \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
A FeatureCollection of \code{\link{data-Polygon}} features with
properties listed as \code{out_field}
}
\description{
Minimum
}
\details{
Calculates the variance value of a field for \code{\link{data-Point}}
features within a set of \code{\link{data-Polygon}} features.
}
\examples{
poly <- lawn_data$polygons_average
pt <- lawn_data$points_average
lawn_min(poly, pt, 'population', 'min')
}
